## About The Project

The Basis Of Trust is an application that helps the user easily and transparently manage debts between friends, because trust is based on accurate accounting.
After registering and logging in, you can easily find your friends by email or username and after accepting the friend request, you can generate Expenses or Settle Up.
For example, if 5 people went to the cinema and one person pays the cost, just quickly create an expense and add the participants, then TBOT will manage who and to whom it belongs.
